This project is a replica of the Applitools Demo application located at https://demo.applitools.com/ 

I felt this application has a good looking UI (all credits to their Software engineers and UI Designers) for practicing of Front end development. 

Hence, I used this demo website as a reference for practicing front end development without using the actual source codes (apart from using the static files like images, icons, etc)

The original web page uses Bootstrap CSS. In this project, I have tried re-building this using plain CS (without using any third partly CSS libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).
