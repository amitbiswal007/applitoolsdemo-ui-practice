This project is a replica of the Applitools Demo application located at https://demo.applitools.com/ 

I felt this application has a good looking UI (all credits to their Software engineers and UI Designers) for practicing of Front end development. 

Hence, I used this demo website as a reference for practicing front end development without using the actual source codes (apart from using the static files like images, icons, etc)
